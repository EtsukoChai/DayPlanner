IMPORTANT!

Do not open or edit the .php files located inside the 'dayplanner_api' folder using
and IDE other than Android Studio. If you do, several important project files will
be changed and your project will no longer work in Android Studio. If you need to
edit them with a different IDE, then remove the entire 'dayplanner_api' folder from
the 'DayPlanner' project folder and place it into another directory. When you are
finished editting, you can then move the entire folder back into your project directory
to commit your changes. This will save us all from a lot of headaches.
